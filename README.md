# Ahlan Mira

Hello, my name is **Ahlan Mira**.  
I am currently in the 3rd year of a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science â€” Networks and Development at the Montsouris campus (Paris).  
Passionate about cybersecurity and how systems work, I develop tools and share them here.

## What I do
- Pentesting & OSINT: penetration testing, information gathering, attack surface analysis.  
- Techniques I use (for authorized testing only): SQL injection testing, ARP spoofing attacks (in controlled environments), etc.  
- Development of system tools for analysis and information collection.

## Projects
- **Nexora**: a tool to gather system information on Windows and Linux and to generate screenshots on the target device (for use only in legal and authorized contexts). Nexora also includes OSINT automation features to search for sensitive information and potential vulnerabilities.  
- **Covaciel**: design of an intelligent miniature car.

Ethical note: I publish and test security techniques only within a legal framework (explicit authorization, lab environment, or CTF). I do not encourage or assist with unauthorized use.
